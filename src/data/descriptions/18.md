New funding for 2 new Evening Reporting Centers, which are [court programs](https://www.phila.gov/programs/court-programs-for-youth) that serve as an after-school, community-based alternative to placement for youth ages 14 to 18. Activities offered at the Evening Reporting Centers include workshops on cognitive behavioral life skills, music and arts education, and supervised community service experience. If ordered by the court, youth attend programs at the Evening Reporting Centers for six months and must wear GPS ankle bracelets.
