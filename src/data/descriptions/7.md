title: Parks & Recreation Budget Increase
---
The budget increase for the [Department of Parks and Recreation](https://www.phila.gov/departments/philadelphia-parks-recreation/), which restores most, but not all, of the pandemic-related budget cut in FY21. Despite this increase, the department’s budget is still $3M (5%) below its pre-pandemic budget level. 

The added funding is not targeted to specific anti-violence programs but instead funds a number of items in the department’s budget:

- Restorations for the [Dell Music Center](https://thedellmusiccenter.com/): $800k; 
- Restoration of seasonal program operations: $900K; 
- Aquatics program restoration: $3.1M; 
- Positions for community service program: $753k;
- [Keyspots](https://www.phillykeyspots.org/) restoration: $400k, and;
- General restoration of operations: $1M.
