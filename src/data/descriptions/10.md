Rather than reduce the BIRT tax rate, City Council negotiated additional funding for the [Commerce Department](https://www.phila.gov/departments/department-of-commerce/). This funding includes increased support for the hospitality industry ($3M), the [Taking Care of Business Clean Corridors](https://www.phila.gov/programs/phl-taking-care-of-business/) program ($1.7M), community economic development support ($600k), and container village ($300k).
