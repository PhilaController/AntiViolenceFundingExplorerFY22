title: Free Library Budget Increase
---
The budget increase for the [Free Library](https://www.freelibrary.org/), which restores most, but not all, of the pandemic-related budget cut in FY21. Despite this increase, the department’s budget is still $3.1M (7%) below its pre-pandemic budget level. 

The added funding is not targeted to specific anti-violence programs but instead funds a number of items in the department’s budget:

- Restoration of 5-day service: $1.9M, and; 
- [The LEAP After School Program](https://libwww.freelibrary.org/programs/leap/): $600k.
